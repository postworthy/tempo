Use this repository as a starter pack.

Required actions before non-trivial code changes:
1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `BOOTSTRAP.md`.
2. If `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` is unfilled, ask the mandatory intake questions from `BOOTSTRAP.md`.
3. Fill `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` and update `SPEC.md`.
4. Propose the first implementation change and wait for approval.

Always use `pnpm verify` as canonical verification.
