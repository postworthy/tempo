# TEMPLATE_HISTORY

This folder preserves governance/process history created while building Tempo itself.

Purpose:

- keep evidence that the template process was followed,
- keep live project governance folders clean for new users.

## What Stays Active

For new projects, active governance record folders should start clean:

- `PROPOSALS/` contains only `TEMPLATE.md`
- `REVIEWS/` contains only `TEMPLATE.md`
- `RCA/` contains only `TEMPLATE.md`

## What Lives Here

- `TEMPLATE_HISTORY/PROPOSALS/*`: template-development proposal records
- `TEMPLATE_HISTORY/REVIEWS/*`: template-development review records (if any)
- `TEMPLATE_HISTORY/RCA/*`: template-development RCAs (if any)

Files in `TEMPLATE_HISTORY/` are not active project records and must not be treated as such.
