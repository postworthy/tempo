# Tempo

Use this repository as a starter pack for AI-assisted software projects.

## One Shot

```bash
codex "Please clone and use the tempo vibe coding starter pack via `git clone https://github.com/postworthy/tempo.git` and use it as the basis for my project."
```

## Quick Start (One Command)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/postworthy/tempo.git && cd tempo && codex "Use this repo as my starter pack. Read AGENTS.md and BOOTSTRAP.md, ask me the required intake questions, then draft PROJECT-BRIEF.md and SPEC.md for approval before coding."
```

If you are not using `codex`, replace `codex` with your assistant CLI (`claude`, `opencode`, etc.) and keep the same prompt text.
